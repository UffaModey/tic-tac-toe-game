# tic-tac-toe-game

Tic-Tac-Toe is an iPhone application developed on XCode, Apple's integrated development environment for macOS. It is a multiple view game that can be played by a single player (the user against the computer) or by multiple players (two users against themselves). 
    
 When the application is run, the home page is displayed. On this screen, the user is able to;

- Open the "How to play" page to view the game instructions.
- Start a player against the computer match using the "Player Vs Computer"
- Start a player against another user match by clicking on the "Player Vs Player" button.

At the end of each game round, the winner is displayed and the user can restart the game or go back to the home screen.
